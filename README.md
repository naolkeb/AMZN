# Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis

In this project, I am looking through amazon reviews of 5 products looking at the sentiment over time. First, I scrape the reviews from the first 200 pages for each review. The reviews are cleaned and are sent to a google cloud sql server where they are updated weekly. The data is then pulled from the the server and sentiment analysis is done in R.
